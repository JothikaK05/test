I worked on a summer research internship at RWTH Aachen University, Germany in the Institute of Structural Mechanics and Lightweight Design. I performed thermal simulations in OpenFOAM for a composite of PCM and lattice structure sample by varying heating orientation, cell size, and gravity, according to re-entry conditions to determine the effect of convection on thermal performance. Updated the custom PCMLattice solver to the latest OpenFOAM version using C++ in Ubuntu.Conducted an extensive literature review to document the suitable materials for re-entry conditions. Observed and documented various plots of Temperature-Time-Liquid Fraction of reduced melting time by increasing gravity and studied the pattern of Rayleigh-Benard convection cells using ParaView, Python and Julia Scripts.
