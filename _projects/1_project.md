### Overview
As part of my bachelor's thesis, I worked on the Design and Analysis of Flexible Heat Pipes for Space Application. 

<p><b>Abstract:</b><br>Heat pipes are pivotal in high-efficiency heat transmission applications, especially where compactness is vital, such as in space environments. These devices are essentially sealed tubes with interior surfaces lined with a porous capillary wick, utilising the phase change phenomenon and capillary action to transport heat effectively. This research focuses on the numerical modelling and experimental validation of flexible heat pipes, aiming to optimise their performance under various operational conditions and geometric configurations. The study commences with the simulation of boiling and condensation in a thermosyphon system using deionized water, validated against empirical data to ensure accuracy. Subsequently, the investigation extends to straight-geometry heat pipes with wicks, analysing the synergistic effects of evaporation-condensation and capillary action. A critical aspect of the research involves assessing the impact of bending the pipes at different angles (0째, 30째, 60째, and 90째) with varying water infill capacities (10%, 30%, and 50%) and with power ranges of 25W to 250W, to understand the performance dynamics and enhance the flexibility of the heat pipes. Experimental setups include a heating block, a condenser unit, and an adiabatic section, with steady-state temperature measurements providing data for thermal conductivity and resistance calculations. Numerically, the system components, including the aluminium rod heat source and cooling block cold water flow, were modelled and analysed in ANSYS FLUENT using multiphase Volume of Fluid (VOF) and Lee model for mass transfer. Upon analysis, the model successfully captured boiling and condensation phenomenon in thermosyphon, capillary action in a porous wick, and also combined effect in entire heat pipe setup, paving the way for potential zero-gravity applications. Results from numerical simulations closely matched the experimental trends with 17% difference, demonstrating a reduction in thermal conductivity with increasing bending angles. Furthermore, the numerical models should be validated against all experimental results to enhance overall the overall performance of heat pipes, making them more suited for space applications where efficiency and compact design are paramount.
