### Overview
As part of my research internship at IIT Bombay, I worked on Design and Analysis of Amphibian Aircraft. Carried out an extensive literature review on amphibian systems that can take off and land on both water and land and traverse underwater. Led a team of six students working on design, analysis, propulsion, control, and communication aspects.
