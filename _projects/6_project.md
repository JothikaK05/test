### Overview
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Developed a self-sustainable, efficient glider that detects forest fires using image processing and alerts the base station. Participated in Sangam '21 in the Energy and Environment domain and secured second place. Presented in RDME conference and published as a research article in AIP Conference Proceedings.

<p><b>Abstract:</b><br>
Each year, between 60,000 and 80,000 forest fires occur, destroying between 3 and 10 million hectares. Therefore, it becomes vital that it is detected and prevented at their premature stage. Albatross is a self-sustaining glider with a wingspan of 2.8m, that will aid in early detection of forest fires, thereby limiting the scope of damage. It glides at an altitude of 240ft and transmits live feeds of the region it is covering to the base station for image processing, alerting the officials in charge with the exact GPS location if any fire/smoke is detected. The major advantage of this glider over other drones is that it is energy efficient. It can cruise for a longer period of time using the solar panels embedded on the wings and has an energy storage unit for powering it in the night. SOLIDWORKS and ANSYS softwares were used to analyze the stresses and displacements at every point on the wing to obtain an optimal aerodynamic design. This would be a cheap and effective solution for forest fire prevention compared to other existing methods such as ground based temperature sensors and satellite imaging.
