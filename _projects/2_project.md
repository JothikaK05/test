### Overview
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I worked on a research internship at RWTH Aachen University, Germany, in the Institute of Structural Mechanics and Lightweight Design during the summer of 2023. This was  fully funded by DAAD Wise Scholarship.

<p><b>Abstract:</b><br>
With the rapid advancement in space industry, the utilization of reusable launch vehicles has become integral to achieving sustainable development goals. However, these vehicles encounter extreme re-entry conditions characterized by high gravitational forces and elevated temperatures, therefore the development of a robust thermal protection system is imperative. In this research, a comprehensive investigation into the use of composite materials which involves phase change materials and lattice structures aimed at enhancing material properties, particularly thermal conductivity has been conducted. To assess the performance of these materials under varying conditions, computational thermal simulations have been executed using OpenFOAM software. A custom PCMLattice solver (updated to latest version using C++ in Ubuntu) has been employed to study the thermal effects by varying cell sizes, heating conditions and orientations. Additionally, the impact of increasing gravitational forces on the heat transfer model of these materials has been explored. The simulation results, including graphical representations and melting front visualization in ParaView are presented. From the results, it is observed that the direction in which heat is supplied and gravity acts plays a pivotal role, in particular, the bottom orientation demonstrates the least melting time due to convective effects. Furthermore, as gravitational forces increase, the melting time of the material diminishes, with higher permeability cells exhibiting earlier melting. These findings have significant implications for the design and optimization of thermal protection systems for reusable launch vehicles operating in challenging re-entry environments.
