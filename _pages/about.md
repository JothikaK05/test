I am currently a master's student pursuing Aerospace Engineering at Delft University of Technology, Netherlands, specializing in Aerospace Structures and Materials. My research interest lies in computational structural analsyis, composite structures and sustainable aviation. 

I graduated from National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli, India with bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering (First- Class with Distinction). Previously, I pursued my summer research internship at the [Institute of Structural Mechanics and Lightweight Design](https://www.sla.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~fald/institut-fuer-strukturmechanik-und-leichtbau/?lidx=1), RWTH Aachen University, Germany. My work involved developing a thermal protection system for the re-entry of launch vehicles, exploring the effects of natural convection on heat transfer through simulations in OpenFOAM. I also worked on design of flexible heat pipes for space applications which involved both experimental and numerical modelling, as part of my bachelor's thesis. Additionally, I conducted research on the design and analysis of amphibious aircraft during an internship at IIT Bombay.

During my undergraduate studies, I served as Vice President of The Third Dimension, the university's Aviation Club, where I led a passionate team in research projects and competitions involving plane and drone design, analysis, and fabrication. Throughout my journey, I have been recognized with several prestigious scholarships and have developed hands-on technical skills, strong leadership, problem-solving abilities, and effective time management. Beyond my research, I enjoy creating [digital art](https://www.instagram.com/jo_creations_/), performing Bharathanatyam (Classical dance form), trying out new cusines, and travelling to new places.

I am always eager to learn, collabrate, and work towards the making an meaningful impact in the aerospace industry.
