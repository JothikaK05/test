I am currently a master's student pursuing Aerospace Engineering at Delft University of Technology, Netherlands, specializing in Aerospace Structures and Materials. Driven by passion for problem-solving and sustainability, my research interests center around computational structural analsyis, composite structures and sustainable aviation. 

I graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering (First Class with Distinction) from the National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli, India. My academic journey has been enriched by hands-on research experiences. During my summer internship at the [Institute of Structural Mechanics and Lightweight Design](https://www.sla.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~fald/institut-fuer-strukturmechanik-und-leichtbau/?lidx=1), RWTH Aachen University, Germany, I contributed to developing a thermal protection system for re-entry vehicles, exploring the effects of natural convection on heat transfer through simulations in OpenFOAM. For my bachelor’s thesis, I worked on analysis of flexible heat pipes for space applications, combining experimental and numerical modeling. Additionally, I conducted research on the design and analysis of amphibious aircraft during an internship at IIT Bombay.

During my undergraduate studies, I served as Vice President of The Third Dimension, the university's Aviation Club, where I led a passionate team in research projects and competitions involving plane and drone design, analysis, and fabrication. Throughout my journey, I have been recognized with several prestigious scholarships and have developed hands-on technical skills, strong leadership, problem-solving abilities, and effective time management. Beyond research, I enjoy creating [digital art](https://www.instagram.com/jo_creations_/), performing Bharathanatyam (a classical Indian dance form), cooking new cuisines, and traveling to new destinations to create memorable experiences.

I am always eager to learn, collabrate, and work towards the making an meaningful impact in the aerospace industry.
