I am currently a master's student pursuing Aerospace Engineering at Delft University of Technology, Netherlands, specializing in Aerospace Structures and Materials. My research interests lie in <span style="background-color: #e6f7ff; color: rgb(4, 58, 115); padding: 0 5px; border-radius: 4px;">Computational Mechanics</span>, <span style="background-color: #e6f7ff; color: rgb(4, 58, 115); padding: 0 5px; border-radius: 4px;">Composite Structures</span>, and <span style="background-color: #e6f7ff; color: rgb(4, 58, 115); padding: 0 5px; border-radius: 4px;">Sustainable Aviation</span>. I am passionate about tackling challenges in these fields and contributing to innovative solutions in aerospace engineering.

I graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering (First Class with Distinction) from the National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli, India. My academic journey has been shaped by hands-on research experiences. During a summer internship at the <a href="https://www.sla.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~fald/institut-fuer-strukturmechanik-und-leichtbau/?lidx=1" style="color: rgb(4, 58, 115);">Institute of Structural Mechanics and Lightweight Design</a>, RWTH Aachen University, Germany, I contributed to developing a thermal protection system for re-entry vehicles, focusing on natural convection heat transfer simulations in OpenFOAM. My bachelor’s thesis explored the analysis of flexible heat pipes for space applications, blending experimental and numerical modeling. Additionally, I conducted research on the design and analysis of amphibious aircraft during an internship at IIT Bombay.

During my undergraduate studies, I served as Vice President of **The Third Dimension**, the university's Aviation Club. I led a team of passionate individuals in projects and competitions involving plane and drone design, analysis, and fabrication. Throughout my academic journey, I have been recognized with several prestigious scholarships, developed hands-on technical expertise, and strengthened my leadership, problem-solving, and time management skills. 

Beyond research, I express my creativity through <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jo_creations_/" style="color: rgb(4, 58, 115);">digital art</a>, performing Bharathanatyam (a classical Indian dance form), experimenting with cooking new cuisines, and traveling to new destinations to create memorable experiences.

I am always eager to learn, collaborate, and contribute meaningfully to advancements in the aerospace industry.
