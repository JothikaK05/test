I am a master's student pursuing Aerospace Engineering at Delft University of Technology, Netherlands, with a focus on Aerospace Structures and Materials. I am an aspiring researcher specialising in UAV design, composite structures and computational mechanics, with a strong research background, academic excellence and achievements, including prestigious scholarships.

I have graduated from National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli with B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering Degree, First- Class with Distinction. I have completed my research internship at the Institute of Structural Mechanics and Lightweight Design, RWTH Aachen University, Germany. I was involved in developing a thermal protection system for the re-entry of launch vehicles, in which I investigated the effect of natural convection on heat transfer by performing simulations in OpenFOAM. Previously, I worked on research and modelling of an Amphibian Aircraft during my internship at IIT Bombay. 

I was also the Vice President at The Third Dimension, which is the Aviation Club of NITT, where I led a dynamic team of aviation enthusiasts and actively work on various research projects and competitions involving the design, analysis, and fabrication of planes and drones. Throughout my journey, I have honed hands-on technical skills while demonstrating strong leadership, problem-solving abilities, and efficient time management to balance academic, research, and extracurricular commitments.

I am always eager to learn more, connect with people who share my interests and goals, and apply my skillset to contribute to advancements in the mechanical and aerospace industry.
