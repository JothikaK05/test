## Analysis of Thermal protection system of reusable launch vehicles (2023)

 At the Institute of Structural Mechanics and Lightweight Design, I performed thermal simulations in
 OpenFOAM for a composite of PCM and lattice structure sample by varying heating orientation, cell size, and
 gravity, according to re-entry conditions to determine the effect of convection on thermal performance.
 Updated the custom PCMLattice solver to the latest OpenFOAM version using C++ in Ubuntu.
 Conducted an extensive literature review to document the suitable materials for re-entry conditions.
 Observed and documented various plots of Temperature-Time-Liquid Fraction of reduced melting time by increasing
 gravity and studied the pattern of Rayleigh-Benard convection cells using ParaView, Python and Julia Scripts.
